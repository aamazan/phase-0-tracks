# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the use of iteration to improve upon existing code. It's useful because it allows programmers to roll back code if there are issues or bugs that arise as a result of a new version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separate version of existing code in a git repository. It allows you to make multiple versions of your code that can be modified independently without modifying the master code. This makes it easier to see the different stages code may have gone through and allows us to pinpoint exactly where our problems may be coming from.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is an update to the repository that includes specified changes. A good commit message should be detailed and should tell the reader what was changed between this and the prevous commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge don't have the same commits.
